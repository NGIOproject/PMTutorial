# SC21 Practical Persistent Memory Programming: PMDK and DAOS - Machine accounts
To undertake the practical exercises in this tutorial you will need an account on our system. We will provide you with a guest account on the system. The account name will be of the form ngguestXX (where XX is replaced by a number such as 01, 02, etc...).

If you do not have an account assigned to you please contact the tutorial organisers, or email  a.jackson@epcc.ed.ac.uk and he will forward you details of how to obtain an account on the system. It's a quick process so should require minimal effort for you.

Once you have an account (username and password) for the system should be able to access it as follows:

```
- ssh ngguestXX@hydra-vpn.epcc.ed.ac.uk
- then ssh nextgenio-login2
```
